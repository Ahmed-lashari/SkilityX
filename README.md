## 🔍 Testing Strategy


* Integration Testing: For flow-based testing
> Only inegrated tests for some important features are written.
---

## 🔔 Firebase Firestore Structure

> Will be shared

---

## 🚧 What’s Missing

The current version is a **Flutter UI + Firebase integrated**, but to make SkilityX a scalable and production-ready app, the following enhancements are **planned**:

* 🔔 Push Notifications (for iOS)
* 🎯 Further responsive UI as per user actions.

---

## 👥 The Vision

SkilityX connects **skill seekers** with **skill sharers** in a community built on **knowledge exchange**. Users can:

* Discover a skill
* Send requests to others.
* Accept requests and discuss further via exchanging contacts.
